      <p>A new era in Islamic Law Research.</p>

      <p>
        The world of Islamic law is vast and rich in knowledge but almost
        inaccessible to researchers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Limited access to physical copies requires researchers to travel to
        far-flung libraries or private collections scattered across different
        continents, from Cairo to Istanbul, from Rabat to Jakarta.
      </p>

      <p>
        The absence of a comprehensive catalogue results in wasted hours spent
        locating pertinent texts, often navigating through complex and obscure
        references.
      </p>

      <p>The process is time-consuming and frustratingly slow.</p>

        <li>Create a universal catalogue for Islamic law research</li>
        <li>Build tools for researchers to efficiently navigate the texts</li>
